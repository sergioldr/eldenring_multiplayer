  itemDescription: Forged from the very essence of the Aether, the Blade of Aetheris
    pulsates with arcane energy. Its ethereal, crystalline blade shimmers with shifting
    hues of violet and blue, making it appear almost intangible to the naked eye.
    Enchanted by ancient sorcerers, the sword is capable of channeling the wielder's
    magical power, enhancing spells and unleashing devastating arcane strikes. The
    hilt is wrapped in a dark, enchanted fabric that never frays, and the guard is
    adorned with glowing runes that hum softly when the sword is drawn. This sword
    not only cuts through flesh but rends the very fabric of reality itself.
