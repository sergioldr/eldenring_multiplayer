  itemDescription: Forged in the ancient fires of a long-lost kingdom, the Sword
    of the Dawn is a perfectly balanced weapon favored by both novice and seasoned
    warriors alike. Its sleek, double-edged blade shines with a faint silver glow,
    reminiscent of the first light of day, while intricate runes are etched along
    its length, said to bestow the wielder with swift and decisive strikes. With
    a simple yet elegant cross-guard and a polished leather grip, this sword excels
    in quick slashes, precise thrusts, and agile parries. Its versatility makes it
    the perfect weapon for those who value speed and technique over brute force.
